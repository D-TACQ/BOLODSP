Build lmfit like this:

visit https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/mlz/lmfit. get .targ.gz

tar xvzf lmfit-6.1.tgz 
cd lmfit-6.1/
./configure --host=arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi
make
cd ..
ln -s lmfit-6.1 lmfit
make

When compiling lmfit with the new compiler I did the following:
./configure --target="/tools/Xilinx/SDK/2018.3/gnu/aarch32/lin/gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc"

This was because with --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc the config was complaining.
Probably not worth digging too deep into this as we are using an older
version of LMFIT that is not available anymore.

Since this version is not available I have included the tar ball in
the commit so it is available forevermore for us.
